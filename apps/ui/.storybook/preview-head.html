  @description Provides a workaround for interaction tests in Storybook with Vite.
  @reference https://storybook.js.org/docs/builders/vite#interaction-tests-not-working-as-expected
  @version 1.0.0

  This file sets the `global` property on the `window` object to ensure compatibility
  with Storybook's interaction tests when using the Vite builder.

     * Sets the `global` property on the `window` object.
     *
     * @description Some Storybook interaction tests rely on `global` being defined.
     * Vite's build process can cause issues with this expectation. This script ensures
     * that `window.global` is defined as `window` to resolve these issues.
     *
     * For more details, refer to the documentation:
     * @see https://storybook.js.org/docs/builders/vite#interaction-tests-not-working-as-expected
