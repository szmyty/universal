## **✅ Best Practices for Secure Contributions**
When contributing code, please follow these **security best practices**:

✔ **Avoid hardcoding secrets** (API keys, passwords).
✔ **Use secure dependencies** (run `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, or `snyk test`).
✔ **Sanitize user input** (to prevent XSS and SQL injection).
✔ **Follow the principle of least privilege** (restrict permissions where possible).
✔ **Review third-party dependencies** for known vulnerabilities.

## **🔍 Security Tools**
We use the following tools to **automate security checks**:
- **[Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot)** → Automatic dependency updates.
- **[Snyk](https://snyk.io/)** → Scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **[Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/)** → Security scanning for containers.
- **[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)** → Detects secrets in Git commits.
- **[Lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis)** → Audits system configuration.

🔗 **You can run security scans manually using:**
```sh
npm audit fix  # For Node.js projects
pip-audit      # For Python projects
snyk test      # Run Snyk security scan
trivy fs .     # Scan entire repository
```
