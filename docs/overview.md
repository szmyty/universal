# üåê Holistic Project Summary

## üß≠ Overview

Over the past several months, I‚Äôve worked across two complex internal projects under high cognitive load and personal/emotional strain. Despite this, I built foundational systems, ensured long-term scalability, and contributed architectural foresight and tooling to enable future development with significantly less friction. Much of this work was performed while navigating ambiguity, underspecification, and production deadlines, with minimal team support.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Project 1: Kepler-GL + Full-Stack Mapping System

### üåç Key Contributions

- **Extended Kepler-GL** to support data layer manipulation, export, and future full-stack persistence via API
- Integrated **FastAPI backend** using design patterns (Repository Pattern, DAO) for future backend modularity (e.g., Postgres ‚Üí TileDB)
- Built **multi-environment system** (local/demo/prod) using Docker Compose with per-environment variable injection
- Enabled full **local-first development** with seamless environment switching and reproducibility
- Dockerized entire system with **health checks** for reliable service orchestration
- Created a custom **"Nuke Docker" script** to cleanly reset project containers using label filtering
- Implemented **Apache reverse proxy** (migrated from Caddy) to support OIDC via Keycloak, serve frontend, and inject user context
- Built and exported a **Keycloak realm** with multiple dev users and roles, auto-imported on container start for rapid testing
- Created a **universal DevContainer** with pinned dependencies, `asdf`, and `Taskfile` tooling for consistent local onboarding
- Developed **PyTest test suite** for API endpoints, including similarity checks and mock data tests
- Migrated frontend codebase to **TypeScript** for stronger type safety and maintainability
- Switched frontend build system to **Vite**, allowing flexible local dev and optimized production builds
- Set up **Taskfile-based WebSocket proxy** scaffold to support hot module reloading (low-priority, in-progress)
- Configured Storybook for **component-driven development**, enabling isolated UI testing with mock data

## üß© Project 2: Gradio-Based Document Filter UI

### üõ†Ô∏è Contributions

- Extended existing Gradio app with **document type search/filter functionality**
- Migrated significant portions to **TypeScript** for future frontend maintainability
- Scaffolded a **React frontend setup** using architecture from Project 1 (precautionary, currently unused)

## üßò Notes & Context

- While not all systems are fully polished, nearly all core architecture is in place and built for **ease of iteration**
- Many tasks were **large, underspecified, or ambiguous**, often delivered under time pressure
- Most decisions prioritized **developer experience, clarity, and long-term stability**, even during production delivery
- The majority of this work was completed during an intense post-divorce period, while navigating extreme burnout and financial stress
- Despite significant cognitive load and executive dysfunction, systems were designed, tested, and deployed ‚Äî while preparing the foundation for more sustainable feature development in the future
