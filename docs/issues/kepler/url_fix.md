## 🧠 General Task

### 🧭 Objective

Fix missing agriculture-related image(s) in the frontend. The image path likely wasn’t mapped or referenced correctly during implementation.

### 🗺️ Plan

- [ ] Review where the agriculture image is expected to be displayed (e.g., cards, legend, or map layers)
- [ ] Check for typos or missing imports in the image path reference
- [ ] Ensure the image exists in the correct directory (e.g., `public/`, `assets/`, or imported via `import`)
- [ ] Verify that the image loads correctly in both dev and production builds

### 🔗 References / Resources

- Image directory (e.g., `src/assets/images/`)
- Error message in console or fallback behavior
- Related visual components (where the image should appear)
