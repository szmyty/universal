# Wget Configuration File (.wgetrc)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains configuration settings for Wget, a free utility
# for non-interactive download of files from the web. It allows
# customization of various aspects of Wget's behavior including
# proxy settings, download behavior, and more.
#
# The settings defined in this file will be applied globally to all
# Wget operations initiated by the user.
#
# Usage:
# Place this file in your home directory or refer to it using the
# --config option when running Wget.
#
# Example:
#   wget --config=/path/to/.wgetrc [URL]
#
# Note: Modify the settings in this file according to your specific
# download requirements and network configuration.

# Consider relative URLs in input files (specified via the ‘input’ command or the ‘--input-file’/‘-i’ option, together with ‘force_html’ or ‘--force-html’) as being relative to string—the same as ‘--base=string’. This is useful when you want to mirror the files from an old URL layout to a new one.

# Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format. Each file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is based on a hash value derived from the certificate. This is achieved by processing a certificate directory with the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL.
